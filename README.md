# glvis
 glVIS is a PVS (Potentially Visible Set) builder specially designed to be used with OpenGL ports of the DOOM game engine. It extends the “GL-Friendly Nodes” with a new lump named “GL_PVS”. Basicly it’s a subsector accept table designed for rendering engine to skip the subsectors that can’t be visible from viewer’s subsector.
